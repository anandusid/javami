In my javami project, I handle the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Hereâ€™s a structured overview of the process:

1. **Configuration Files**: 
   - **`buildspec.yml`**: This file defines the build instructions and specifies how the application should be built.
   - **`appspec.yml`**: This file outlines the deployment steps and details how the application should be deployed.
   - **Dockerfile**: This file is used to containerize the application, specifying the environment and dependencies required to run the app.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - **GitHub Actions**: I leverage GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process. This ensures that every change goes through a standardized pipeline, maintaining code quality and consistency.

3. **Deployment**:
   - **AWS**: The deployment is carried out on AWS, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure for the application.
   - **Auto Build**: The process is automated to build and deploy the application efficiently, reducing manual intervention and potential errors.

By using these tools and processes, I ensure that the application is built, tested, and deployed seamlessly, following best practices in CI/CD.
