My name is Anandu Sidharthan, and I am from Kollam, Kerala. I have a B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering and approximately 8 years of work experience.

I began my career at Satmetrix, a US-based product company, where I worked from February 2016 to November 2017. The product I worked on collects customer feedback via email, SMS, and IVR. Clients can create custom questions and choose the best medium for their customers. The application also manages questions and answers, helping clients gather customer opinions quickly. My role was a UI developer using the Backbone.js framework, and I also fixed backend bugs in Java Spring. My daily tasks included participating in scrum meetings, working on enhancements, fixing bugs, analyzing code, and unit testing.

From November 2017 to July 2019, I worked at Ospyn, a product-based company in Kerala. The product, DDFS, is a CMS application that manages file flow through a workflow and is used by public sector and private banks in Kerala. I worked as a Full Stack Developer, using Java Spring MVC for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. My responsibilities included developing APIs with Spring MVC, participating in client discussions, creating POCs, testing APIs, fixing bugs, and assisting the DevOps team with deployments.

Currently, I am working at SCG Oito Digital, a product-based company in Thailand, focusing on the e-commerce domain. I am involved in the Mitraruma project, which is hosted in Indonesia and includes both seller and buyer applications. The backend uses Java and Spring Boot, following a microservices architecture, while the frontend is built with React.js. My role involves developing APIs for internal communication between microservices and creating APIs to invoke external libraries. I primarily work on the payment area, participate in grooming sessions and technical discussions, and prioritize fixing production bugs. We follow agile methodology in this project.
