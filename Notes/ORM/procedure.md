To add another stored procedure to retrieve the employee name based on date of birth in addition to the previous one, you'll need to follow similar steps but with adjustments for the new requirement. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Step 1: Create the Stored Procedure in the Database

Create a stored procedure in your database that accepts a date of birth parameter and returns the employee name. Here is an example in SQL:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeNameByDateOfBirth(IN dob DATE)
BEGIN
    SELECT name FROM Employee WHERE date_of_birth = dob;
END;
```

### Step 2: Define the Stored Procedure in Spring Data JPA

#### 2.1. Add JPA Repository

Extend your existing repository interface for the `Employee` entity and define a new method to call the stored procedure.

```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.query.Procedure;
import org.springframework.data.repository.query.Param;

public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {

    @Procedure(name = "Employee.getEmployeesByAge")
    List<Employee> getEmployeesByAge(@Param("age") Integer age);

    @Procedure(name = "Employee.getEmployeeNameByDateOfBirth")
    String getEmployeeNameByDateOfBirth(@Param("dob") Date dob);
}
```

#### 2.2. Map the Stored Procedure in the Entity

Annotate your `Employee` entity class to map the new stored procedure.

```java
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@NamedStoredProcedureQuery(
    name = "Employee.getEmployeeNameByDateOfBirth",
    procedureName = "GetEmployeeNameByDateOfBirth",
    parameters = {
        @StoredProcedureParameter(mode = ParameterMode.IN, name = "dob", type = Date.class)
    }
)
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String position;
    private Double salary;
    private Date dateOfBirth; // Assuming date of birth is an attribute of Employee

    // getters and setters
}
```

### Step 3: Service Layer

Add a method in your service class to use the new repository method.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class EmployeeService {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    public String getEmployeeNameByDateOfBirth(Date dob) {
        return employeeRepository.getEmployeeNameByDateOfBirth(dob);
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Controller Layer

Add a new endpoint in your controller to expose the method for retrieving the employee name by date of birth.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class EmployeeController {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeService employeeService;

    @GetMapping("/employees/by-dob")
    public String getEmployeeNameByDateOfBirth(@RequestParam Date dob) {
        return employeeService.getEmployeeNameByDateOfBirth(dob);
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Testing the Setup

Start your Spring Boot application and test the new endpoint by sending a GET request to `/employees/by-dob?dob=yyyy-MM-dd` with the appropriate date format.

This setup will enable your Spring Boot application to call a stored procedure to retrieve the employee name based on the specified date of birth, in addition to the previous functionality for retrieving employees by age.




Yes, exactly. For a single entity, typically only one view should be created, reflecting a specific subset or transformation of the data represented by that entity. This view can be associated with one repository.

However, if you have different use cases or scenarios where you need to access the same entity data in different ways (e.g., different column selections, filters, or transformations), you can create multiple views, each tailored to a specific use case. In this scenario, you'll need to create a separate repository for each view.

So, for a given entity:

1. You can have multiple views representing different perspectives or subsets of the data.
2. Each view should have a unique name.
3. You'll need a separate repository for each view to interact with the data represented by that view.

This allows you to effectively organize and manage your data access logic based on different views of the same underlying entity data.
