class file will come to the class Loader
	ClassLoader Consist of BootStrap Loader(JVM_home/lib/rt.jar) it will take of all the java class which we are using in our code .
	Extension Loader : any external libraries we are using in our code will load from here path( JVM_home/lib/ext) 
	Application Class Loader: Any class in our application itself is required then will take from here.
	
	
	To understand how class loaders work in Java, especially in the context you've described, let's delve into the JVM class loading mechanism and the types of class loaders involved.

### Class Loading in Java

The JVM uses a hierarchical delegation model for class loading. There are three main types of class loaders:

1. **Bootstrap Class Loader**: 
   - It is part of the core JVM and written in native code.
   - It loads the core Java libraries located in the `<JAVA_HOME>/lib` directory, such as `java.lang.String`.

2. **Extension (Platform) Class Loader**:
   - It loads classes from the `<JAVA_HOME>/lib/ext` directory or any other directory specified by the `java.ext.dirs` system property.
   - It handles the platform-specific extensions.

3. **Application (System) Class Loader**:
   - It loads classes from the classpath (typically specified by the `CLASSPATH` environment variable or the `-classpath` command-line option).
   - This class loader loads your application classes, such as `Main` and `Child`.

### Example Scenario

Let's consider the example you provided. We have two classes, `Main` and `Child`. Hereâ€™s how the class loaders would typically work in this scenario:

### Main.java

```java
public class Main {
    private static int counter = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
        System.out.println(child.getMessage());
    }
}
```

### Child.java

```java
public class Child {
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Hello from Child class!";
    }
}
```

### Class Loading Steps

1. **Loading `Main` Class**:
   - When you run the program using `java Main`, the Application (System) Class Loader is invoked to load the `Main` class from the classpath.

2. **Loading `Child` Class**:
   - Inside the `main` method of the `Main` class, an instance of the `Child` class is created.
   - The Application (System) Class Loader loads the `Child` class from the classpath.

3. **Loading `String` Class**:
   - When `child.getMessage()` is called, it returns a `String` object.
   - The `String` class is a core Java class and is loaded by the Bootstrap Class Loader from the `<JAVA_HOME>/lib/rt.jar`.

### Class Loader Hierarchy

- **Bootstrap Class Loader**: Loads core Java classes (e.g., `java.lang.String`).
- **Extension Class Loader**: Loads classes from the extension directories.
- **Application Class Loader**: Loads application-specific classes (e.g., `Main` and `Child`).

### Detailed Class Loading Sequence

1. **Bootstrap Class Loader**:
   - Loads fundamental classes like `java.lang.Object`, `java.lang.String`, and other core classes.
   - This loader is the parent of all other class loaders.

2. **Extension Class Loader**:
   - Loads classes from the extensions directory if needed.

3. **Application Class Loader**:
   - Loads the `Main` class from the classpath.
   - Delegates to its parent class loader (Extension Class Loader) if it can't find the class.
   - The Extension Class Loader, in turn, delegates to the Bootstrap Class Loader if necessary.

### Illustration of the Process

1. **Run Command**:
   ```sh
   java Main
   ```
2. **Application Class Loader**:
   - Tries to load `Main` class.
   - Loads `Main` class bytecode and initializes the static variables (`counter`).
3. **Within `main` Method**:
   - `new Child()`:
     - The Application Class Loader loads the `Child` class.
   - `child.getMessage()`:
     - The `Child` class's method is invoked, which uses `String` (already loaded by the Bootstrap Class Loader).

### Class Loader Example Code

```java
public class Main {
    private static int counter = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassLoader mainClassLoader = Main.class.getClassLoader();
        ClassLoader childClassLoader = Child.class.getClassLoader();
        ClassLoader stringClassLoader = String.class.getClassLoader();

        System.out.println("Main class loader: " + mainClassLoader);
        System.out.println("Child class loader: " + childClassLoader);
        System.out.println("String class loader: " + stringClassLoader);

        Child child = new Child();
        System.out.println(child.getMessage());
    }
}
```

### Output Explanation

- `Main class loader`: Typically, this will be the `Application Class Loader`.
- `Child class loader`: Same as `Main class loader` since `Child` is also part of the application.
- `String class loader`: Will be `null` because `String` is loaded by the Bootstrap Class Loader, which is implemented in native code and not represented by a `ClassLoader` instance in Java.

### Summary

In your example, the `Main` and `Child` classes are loaded by the Application (System) Class Loader, while the `String` class is loaded by the Bootstrap Class Loader. The class loaders work in a hierarchical manner, ensuring that the core Java classes are loaded first by the Bootstrap Class Loader, followed by any extensions, and finally the application-specific classes by the Application Class Loader. This hierarchy ensures a robust and efficient class loading mechanism in the JVM.


Memory Area:

	Class Area, Heap Area, Stack Area, PC register, Native Method Stack

	
To understand how memory areas work in the JVM with the `Main` and `Child` classes, let's break down the process and see how the different memory areas are utilized. We will also address the question about the stack area and its relevance.

### Example Code

**Main.java**
```java
public class Main {
    private static int counter = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
        System.out.println(child.getMessage());
    }
}
```

**Child.java**
```java
public class Child {
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Hello from Child class!";
    }
}
```

### JVM Memory Areas

The JVM divides the memory it manages into several runtime data areas:

1. **Method Area**: Stores class-level information such as class definitions, method data, field data, and static variables.
2. **Heap**: Stores all objects and their instance variables.
3. **Stack Area**: Each thread has its own stack, which stores frames. A frame holds local variables, partial results, and information about the method being executed.
4. **PC Registers**: Each thread has a program counter (PC) register, which points to the next instruction to be executed.
5. **Native Method Stack**: Stores information about native method calls.

### Execution Flow and Memory Usage

Let's see how these areas are utilized during the execution of the `Main` and `Child` classes.

#### 1. **Method Area**

- **Class Loading**: When the `Main` class is loaded, the `Method Area` stores class-level information for `Main` and `Child`.
- **Static Variables**: `counter` (a static variable in `Main`) is stored in the Method Area.

#### 2. **Heap**

- **Object Creation**: When `new Child()` is executed, a new `Child` object is created and stored in the Heap.
- **Instance Variables**: Although `Child` doesn't have instance variables in this example, any instance variables would also be stored in the Heap.

#### 3. **Stack Area**

Each thread has its own stack. For the `main` method execution, the JVM creates a main thread and its stack:

- **Main Thread Stack**: Contains frames for each method call within the main thread.
    - **Frame for `main` Method**: Contains local variables (`args`, `child`), the reference to the `Child` object, and a return address.
    - **Frame for `getMessage` Method**: Created when `child.getMessage()` is called, contains local variables and execution state.

#### 4. **PC Register**

- **Program Counter**: Points to the current instruction being executed within the main thread.

#### 5. **Native Method Stack**

- **Native Methods**: If any native methods are called, information about those calls is stored here. In this example, there are no native methods used.

### Detailed Memory Usage Example

**Main.java**
```java
public class Main {
    private static int counter = 0;  // Stored in Method Area

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();  // Reference stored in Stack, object stored in Heap
        System.out.println(child.getMessage());  // Method call, new frame on Stack
    }
}
```

**Child.java**
```java
public class Child {
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Hello from Child class!";  // Literal stored in String pool (Method Area)
    }
}
```

### How the Stack Area Comes into Play

Even if your class does not explicitly use threads, the main method runs in the main thread, and therefore, the stack area is always utilized. Each method call within the main thread creates a new frame on the stack.

#### Execution without Additional Threads

1. **Class Loading**:
    - `Main` and `Child` classes are loaded, and class information is stored in the Method Area.
    - Static variable `counter` is stored in the Method Area.

2. **Main Method Execution**:
    - The JVM creates the main thread and allocates a stack for it.
    - A frame for the `main` method is pushed onto the stack.
    - Local variables (`args`, `child`) and references are stored in the main method's frame.

3. **Object Creation**:
    - `new Child()` creates a `Child` object in the Heap.
    - The reference to this `Child` object is stored in the main method's frame on the stack.

4. **Method Call**:
    - `child.getMessage()` is called.
    - A new frame for `getMessage` is pushed onto the stack.
    - The return value ("Hello from Child class!") is stored in the stack frame and then printed.

### Summary

- **Method Area**: Stores class-level data, static variables, and method code.
- **Heap**: Stores objects and instance variables.
- **Stack Area**: Stores frames for method calls within each thread, including local variables and references.
- **PC Register**: Points to the current instruction for the executing thread.
- **Native Method Stack**: Stores information about native method calls.

The stack area is always involved whenever methods are executed, regardless of whether additional threads are explicitly created. In the `main` method, the stack frames are used to keep track of method calls and local variables, ensuring that the JVM can manage method execution efficiently.
