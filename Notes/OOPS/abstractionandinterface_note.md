Distinctions:
Emphasis on Contracts vs. Common Behavior:

Interfaces primarily emphasize defining contracts or agreements between classes. They specify a set of methods that implementing classes must adhere to, without dictating how those methods are implemented.
Abstract classes, on the other hand, often emphasize common behavior that can be shared among subclasses. They can provide concrete implementations for some methods while leaving others abstract for subclasses to implement.
Flexibility vs. Code Reuse:

Interfaces offer maximum flexibility by allowing disparate classes to implement the same set of methods in different ways. They promote polymorphism and loose coupling.
Abstract classes are more focused on providing a foundation for subclasses to build upon. They offer a balance between common behavior and specific implementations, allowing for code reuse and specialization.
Decoupling vs. Common State:

Interfaces are effective for decoupling the definition of behaviors from their implementation. They focus on what needs to be done without prescribing how it should be done.
Abstract classes can encapsulate shared state and provide default behavior or utility methods. They emphasize the commonality among subclasses while still allowing for variations in behavior.
Considerations:
Design Goals:

Choose interfaces when your primary goal is to define contracts that multiple classes can implement differently, or when you want to decouple behavior definitions from implementations.
Choose abstract classes when you have a hierarchy of related classes that share common behavior, state, or functionality, and when you want to provide default implementations or utility methods.
Level of Abstraction:

Interfaces provide a higher level of abstraction by focusing solely on method signatures and contracts.
Abstract classes provide a mix of abstraction and implementation, making them suitable for defining common behavior and state in addition to method contracts.
Extensibility vs. Polymorphism:

Interfaces promote extensibility and polymorphism, allowing for a wider variety of implementations and interactions.
Abstract classes promote code reuse and specialization within a specific class hierarchy.
In summary, while there is overlap in the use cases for interfaces and abstract classes, each has its own strengths and considerations. Understanding these differences can help you choose the most appropriate abstraction mechanism for your specific design goals and requirements.
