Primitives and wrapper classes are fundamental concepts in Java, but they serve different purposes.

**Primitives:**
- Primitives are basic data types provided by Java, such as `int`, `double`, `boolean`, etc.
- They are not objects and do not have methods or properties associated with them.
- Primitives are more memory efficient and faster to manipulate than objects.
- Primitives are used for simple data storage and manipulation.

**Wrapper Classes:**
- Wrapper classes are classes provided in Java that encapsulate primitive data types into objects.
- They provide methods and properties to manipulate primitive data types.
- Wrapper classes allow primitives to be used in contexts where objects are required, such as collections (like `ArrayList`), generics, and methods that require objects.
- Wrapper classes also provide utility methods for converting between primitive types and strings, parsing strings to primitives, etc.

Here's a comparison of a primitive (`int`) and its corresponding wrapper class (`Integer`):

```java
// Primitive
int num = 10;

// Wrapper Class
Integer numWrapper = new Integer(10);
```

**When to Use Primitives vs. Wrapper Classes:**
- **Primitives**: Use primitives when you need simple data types for basic operations and memory efficiency is critical.
- **Wrapper Classes**: Use wrapper classes when you need to treat primitives as objects, such as when working with collections, generics, or when you need to utilize the utility methods provided by wrapper classes.

In Java projects, you'll often find a mix of both depending on the requirements of the code. Generally, use primitives for simple data storage and manipulation, and wrapper classes when you need to work with primitives in an object-oriented context or when using features that require objects rather than primitives.
