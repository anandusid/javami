### Explanation of the Singleton Implementation

Your singleton implementation is designed to create only one instance of `singletonClass`, and it uses a technique called "double-checked locking" to ensure thread safety while minimizing synchronization overhead. Let's address your questions and provide an improved version of the code.

### Why `volatile` is Used

The `volatile` keyword ensures that multiple threads handle the `instance` variable correctly when it is being initialized to the `singletonClass` instance. Without `volatile`, it's possible for a thread to see a partially constructed object, which can lead to subtle and hard-to-diagnose bugs. `volatile` prevents these issues by ensuring that the `instance` variable is read from and written to main memory, not a thread-local cache.

### Double-Checked Locking and Synchronization

Double-checked locking is used to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the `instance` variable being `null`) without actually acquiring the lock. Only if the check indicates that locking is necessary does the actual lock proceed. This helps in scenarios where multiple threads might be attempting to get the singleton instance concurrently.

### Improved Version with Proper Syntax

```java
public class SingletonClass {
    // Volatile keyword ensures that multiple threads handle the instance correctly
    private static volatile SingletonClass instance = null;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private SingletonClass() { }

    // Public method to provide access to the singleton instance
    public static SingletonClass getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) { // First check (no locking)
            synchronized (SingletonClass.class) {
                if (instance == null) { // Second check (with locking)
                    instance = new SingletonClass();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Why Synchronize Inside the `if` Block?

**Efficiency**: Synchronizing the entire `getInstance` method would slow down all calls to this method, even after the instance has been created. By synchronizing only when `instance` is `null`, you avoid the performance hit of synchronization after the singleton instance has been initialized.

**Correctness**: Double-checked locking requires two checks to ensure thread safety:

1. **First Check** (Without Lock): Checks if the instance is `null`. This check is outside the synchronized block to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary synchronization once the instance is initialized.
2. **Second Check** (With Lock): Inside the synchronized block, this ensures that no other thread has initialized the instance between the first check and entering the synchronized block.

### Summary

- **`volatile`**: Ensures visibility of changes to the `instance` variable across threads, preventing the use of a partially constructed object.
- **Double-Checked Locking**: Reduces synchronization overhead by only synchronizing the critical section of code that initializes the singleton instance.
- **Synchronization Placement**: Placing synchronization inside the `if (instance == null)` check minimizes performance overhead by not synchronizing the entire method.

This pattern ensures that the `SingletonClass` is lazily initialized and thread-safe, with minimal performance overhead.


public enum SingletonEnum {
    INSTANCE;

    // You can add methods and fields as needed
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Singleton using Enum");
    }
}
