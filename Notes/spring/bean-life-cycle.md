Got it! Let's simplify the explanation and focus on why the bean lifecycle might be relevant for your application.

### Why is the Bean Lifecycle Important?

1. **Initialization Logic:** Sometimes, after creating a bean, you need to perform some setup or initialization tasks. For example, opening a database connection, reading configuration files, or initializing some data structures. The initialization phase is where you can put this logic.

2. **Cleanup Logic:** When your application is shutting down, you might need to release resources, such as closing a database connection or stopping background threads. The destruction phase allows you to add this cleanup logic.

### Simple Example in a Practical Context

Let's say you have a bean that connects to a database. You might want to open the connection when the bean is created and close it when the bean is destroyed.

Here's how you can handle that without implementing interfaces, just using annotations and custom methods:

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define the Bean:**

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean(initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "cleanup")
    public MyDatabaseBean myDatabaseBean() {
        return new MyDatabaseBean();
    }
}
```

2. **Create the Bean Class:**

```java
public class MyDatabaseBean {
    public void init() {
        // Initialization logic, like opening a database connection
        System.out.println("Opening database connection");
    }

    public void cleanup() {
        // Cleanup logic, like closing the database connection
        System.out.println("Closing database connection");
    }

    // Other business logic methods
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something with the database");
    }
}
```

3. **Use the Bean in Your Application:**

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {
    private final MyDatabaseBean myDatabaseBean;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(MyDatabaseBean myDatabaseBean) {
        this.myDatabaseBean = myDatabaseBean;
    }

    public void performAction() {
        myDatabaseBean.doSomething();
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Initialization Phase:** The `init` method is called after the bean is created and dependencies are injected. This is where you put setup logic.
- **Destruction Phase:** The `cleanup` method is called when the application context is shutting down. This is where you put cleanup logic.
- **Business Logic:** The `doSomething` method contains the relevant logic that you use throughout your application.

By understanding and using the bean lifecycle, you can ensure that your application properly initializes resources and cleans them up, which can prevent resource leaks and other issues.
